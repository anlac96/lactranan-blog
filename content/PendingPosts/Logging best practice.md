# Logging Best Practice page

### **1. Benefits of Logging**

- **Troubleshooting:** Helps identify, debug, and resolve issues quickly.
- **Monitoring:** Tracks application behavior and performance over time.
- **Auditing:** Keeps records of system actions for compliance and security.
- **Analysis:** Provides data for improving system reliability and performance.

### **2. Log Structure (Anatomy)**

A well-structured log entry typically includes:

- **Timestamp:** Precise date and time for when the event occurred.
- **Log Level:** Indicates the severity (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
- **Context/Source:** Module, function, or component where the event originated.
- **Message:** Descriptive text explaining the event.
- **Metadata (Optional):** Key-value pairs for additional context (e.g., user ID, session ID).
- **Error/Stack Trace (if applicable):** For failures or exceptions.

Example log structure:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-12-16T12:00:00Z",
    "level": "ERROR",
    "source": "auth_service",
    "message": "Failed to authenticate user",
    "user_id": "12345",
    "error": "Invalid password"
}
```

### **3. When to Log**

- **Key Events:**
  - User interactions (e.g., login, API requests).
  - External system calls (e.g., database, third-party services).
  - Errors, warnings, and exceptions.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Slow queries or transactions.
  - Resource utilization peaks.
- **Unusual Behavior:**
  - Suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).
  - Threshold breaches.

### **4. Log Levels**

- **DEBUG:** Fine-grained details for development and debugging.
- **INFO:** General operational events; system is functioning as expected.
- **WARNING:** Potential issues or unusual circumstances not affecting operations.
- **ERROR:** Failures or problems requiring attention but not critical.
- **CRITICAL/FATAL:** Severe issues causing application/system outages.

### **5. Log Third-Party Integration**

- **Cloud Logging Services:**
  - AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:**
  - Integrate logs with monitoring tools (e.g., **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Datadog**) for real-time alerts.
- **Error Tracking:**
  - Services like **Sentry**, **Bugsnag**, or **Rollbar** for logging and tracking errors with context.
- **Compliance and Auditing:**
  - Tools that ensure logs meet industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

By following these practices, you can ensure logs are meaningful, actionable, and scalable as your system grows.
